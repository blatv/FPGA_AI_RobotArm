# Videos
The demonstration videos are made from parts of the componenets as they work. Note that the full system architecture was not implemented and thus there is no 'one-video' to rule them all.

##Unity
This videos show us a general view of the scena created to capture the synthetic date. It runs the scena in play mode and show us how the script interface allow us to change the direction of the rotation over the target object. As well as the interval of capturing and the name of the output files.
