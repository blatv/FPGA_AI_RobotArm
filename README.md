# Using an FPGA Neural Network to make robotic choices
This repository contains the code, designs and demonstrations for an Embedded System project.

The project consists of the following architecture:

{Insert image overview here}

The different components can be found throughout this repo.

- For the neural network implementation on FPGA, and the neural network training please see folder "NeuralNetwork"
- For the collection of data needed for the neural network, please see folder "Datacollection"
- For the estimation of the entity pose please see the "PoseEstimation"
- For the Phyical design and implementation, such as motor driver and 3D designs, see folder "Arm"
- and finally to see the ROS implementation of the nodes, see the "ros_ws" folder

Any extra images used for the explanation of the system can be found in the "Report/Images" folder.
And Demonstration videos can be found in the "Report/Videos" folder.

The paper used to describe the network has also been uploaded to Report.
