# The Neural Network

## Training
The training was done in Python using the TensorFolow library

## Developing for FPGA
The development of the neural network executer was developed in Vitis_HLS to run on an FPGA

## Development for board
The implementation of the HLS block was done using the Vivado software

The code is build by [N. Malle](https://github.com/nhma20/FPGA_AI/tree/main) during the FPGA AI project.
